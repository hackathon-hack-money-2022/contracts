#### Problems with uniswap
- https://github.com/Uniswap/solidity-lib/blob/master/contracts/libraries/TransferHelper.sol
    - Somethings fails inside here
    - I have enough liquidity, so not sure what the problem is.
- Got it working when calling it directly to the contract

    - Tried to deposit ETH into a smart contract and then call it througth it, but it did not work
- Got it working (finally)
    - I think the problem was that the wrong interface was used for the router

### Rip - the price oracle for uniswap is actually not onchain
- could do something like https://stackoverflow.com/a/71815432
    - Requires user to interact :(
- Never mind should be able to use reserve0/reserve1, but it is on pool level. I think this is ok, but we need to use liquid pool as the oracle.
